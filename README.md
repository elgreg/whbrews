White House Brews Revisited
===========================

I like brewing beer and though the White House could do a lot better than their current recipes. Starting with their Honey Ale, I've revised the recipe to be all-grain with liquid yeast. [View the recipe and step-by-step instructions](http://kfrank.github.com/whbrews/)

Just to note, I'm a designer with relatively little javascript experience, so any help would be great. Also, I've only been brewing for a year, so if you have any tips to improve the process, that would be nice to know as well.
